# Internalising computational equivalence in type theory

These are the things we need to define:

## Languages

First, we must define the following languages.

- [x] CTT language, which is basically untyped LC
- [x] LTT language, which is basically MLTT
- [ ] LCTT language, which is displayed over CTT and LTT

Here 'define' means define their type of algebras, displayed algebras,
postulate the syntax and the induction for the syntax.

## Normalisation

We must define normalisation for LCTT, that is the goal, after all.

To do this, we must:

- [ ] Define or postulate the normal forms for CTT and LTT. We know these both
      exist and are proven in other materials. We can probably skip their
      proofs in Agda. 

- [ ] Define the normal forms for LCTT, in terms of the others.

- [ ] Show normalisation
